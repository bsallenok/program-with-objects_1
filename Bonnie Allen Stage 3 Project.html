        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            A user opens a browser on their computer such as Firefox and requests information
            from a URL such as <a href="http://WWW.Udacity.com">Udacity.com.</a>  The set of rules used to traverse the world wide web is called <span class="bold">HTTP</span> or <span class="italic">Hyper Transfer Protocol</span> and the information sought might be a webpage containing text, videos, images etc. The webpage displayed is written in a language the computer understands called <span class="bold">HTML</span> or <span class="italic">Hypertext Markup Language</span>
            <span class="bold">HTTP</span> finds the <span class="bold">HTML</span> document on the correct server (another type of computer that 
            stores information) and sends it back where the browser 
            interprets and displays 
            the information on the user's screen.

          Why Programmers are so Smart

        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            Programmers have to be smart because computers are stupid!  Programmers must write code in the correct syntax because computers translate the code literally; this can be frustrating but with extreme focus--powerful. Programmers are smarter than computers but they cannot remember all the rules!  If you forget a rule--just look it up!

          <p>
            In programming language there are <span class="bold">tag, element</span>  and <span class="bold">attribute</span>definitions and rules.  In HTML, the <span class="bold">text</span> is <span class="italic">what you see</span> and the <span class="bold">markup</span> is <span class="italic">what it looks like.</span> A tag was used in the previous sentence to make the letters in the word "text" and "markup" appear <span class="bold">bold</span>; it requires an opening tag and a closing tag to create the appearance.  The word "text" is called the <span class="bold">content</span>  and the entire length of this information end to end is called an <span class="bold">element.</span> 
          </p>
          <p>
            As mentioned there are <span class="bold">attributes</span> within elements.  You can look them up on the internet but let me share another example here because <span class="bold">coding is fun!</span> Some tags require an "attribute" like the "img" tag requires an opening tag, an attribute: "src", a link to the image, an "alt" attribute containing text to desribe the image; this is for two reasons 1) in case the link is broken and 2) for the blind.  What no closing tag?  "img" is a <span class="bold">void</span>  tag; and therefore, does not require a closing tag.

            HTML elements are "inline" or "block."  The difference between <span class="bold">inline</span> and <span class="bold">block</span> is that block elements like "p" for paragraph form an <span>invisible box</span> around the content inside of them.

        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            HTML and <span class="bold">CSS</span> Cascading Style Sheets are two of the many languages used to create web pages.  HTML develops the classification or structure and CSS provides the style or look and feel of a web page.  When programmers talk about <span class="bold">DOM</span> Document Object Model, they are talking about the <span class="italic">tree-like</span> structure of a web page. Beginner web page developers should start with big boxes, move to small boxes and literally sketch out their web design with a pen or pencil. Programmers define boxes or containers around their content with <span class="bold">div</span> tags. The <span class="bold">div</span> tag is one of the most important tags used to organize HTML into big and small boxes needed to organize and structure HTML. They use "span" and other tags to help with the styling of their content.

            Text editors like <span class="bold">Scratchpad, Codepen</span>  and <span class="bold">Sublime</span> make writing code easier.  For example, Scratchpad is good for beginners because what's been coded is immediately displayed in a split screen view. Sublime anticipates the tag you need with a pop-up selection box triggered by one or two key-strokes.

          Adding Style with CSS

        <div class="concept-description">   
          <p>
            Programmers use CSS to add style to their HTML structure by
            using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">CSS Reference.</a> Programmers learn possible values and properties of attributes they need to convert their mockup to code. <span class="bold">Cascading</span> means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also to all of those elements' children. However, if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rule takes effect.

          The Box Model and Avoiding Repetition with CSS

          <p>
            Programmers define boxes around their content with "div" tags but its important to remember to use standards. Using standards while positioning boxes will apply the proper semantics, allow all browsers to read your code and any programmer to edit your code.  In addition, avoiding repetition in your code styling will facilitate changes and avoid errors. Standard and consistent use of the <span class="bold">class</span> attribute and CSS Reference will make good practice needed to refine your ability.

          <p>
            Perfect practice calls for <span class="italic">code, test, and refine</span> behavior: look for natural boxes in your design; look for repeated styles and semantic elements; write your HTML; apply styles from Biggest to smallest (Thanks Jacques!); and finally continue to fix your code. These five behaviors will make for perfect practice on your road to fluency!

          <p>
            Programming languages tell the computer what steps to take.  It is important to understand why new languages are invented for computers in place of English or French, German, etc.  The language of humans is too ambiguous and verbose for a computer to understand.  Like the definition of biweekly; is it every two weeks or twice per week?  A computer needs specific <span class="italic">syntax</span>, clear and concise instructions in order to perform the programmers intended task.

        <div class="concept-description">  
          <p>
            The computer language, <span class="bold">Python</span> , which was named from the Monty Python series, uses Backus-Naur form invented to describe languages simply and concisely.  Like English, Python has <span class="bold">grammar rules</span> similar to sentence structure that can be compared as non-terminals to derive terminals.  For example, the English non-terminal <span class="bold">Sentence: Noun, Verb, Object</span> becomes the terminal: 'I like Python.' Python grammar turns the non-terminal <span class="bold">Expression: Expression, Operator, Expression</span> into the terminal: ((3 * 3) + (2**3)).

          <p>
            Python allows the programmer to use names aka <span class="bold">variables</span> to keep track of numbers via the <span class="bold">Assignment Statement</span>.  Programmers assigning a number or value to a variable is powerful because it makes writing and reading code easier. For example, the speed of light in meters per second is 299792458.  Using an <span class="italic">assignment statement</span> in Python: Name = Expression or speed_of_light = 299792458 will display the actual value of the speed of light when "print speed_of_light is run. The programmer no longer has to remember the value of the speed of light in meters per second.

          <p>
            In math, 2+3 <span class="bold">always</span> equals 5. In Python the <span class="bold">=</span> sign means <span class="italic">assignment</span> which means that Python is assigning the expression "5" to a name "variable."  For example, in <span class="bold">my_variable = 5. </span>Python is assigning the "value" 5 to "my_variable." And, because it is a variable, the assignment can be changed. The programmer can make the expression have a different value in the code each time it's evaluated.

            <span class="bold">Strings</span> are a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes: <span class="bold">"I'm a string!"</span> Single or double quotes allowed as long as you open and close with the same type of mark. <span class="bold">'I am a string too!'</span> Strings allow programmers to build search engines and work with any characters they can type on a keyboard.  In Python, the difference between 2+2 and "2" + "2" is the quotes make it a string and the <span class="bold">+</span> sign is an operator that concatonates the two strings.  So, instead of 2+2=4 we have "2"+"2" which is <span class="italic">assigned</span> "22" within the program.

            A <span class="bold">function</span> is something that takes input, does something to that input, and then produces output. For example, a function named<span class="code">sum4</span> might take a set of four numbers as input and produce the sum of those four numbers as output.

            Functions are <span class="bold">made</span> by starting a line of code with the keyword<span class="code">def</span> which means define and then giving the function a name followed by the function <span class="code">parameter(s)</span> in parentheses followed by a colon.

            We can use the <span class="bold">if</span> statement on a <span class="italic">test expression</span> and make a decision based on comparisons. Python has a way to compare numbers and give back a TRUE or FALSE which is known as a <span class="bold">Boolean</span> value. With the <span class="bold">if</span> statement the test expression executes 0 or 1 times depending on if the test executes to TRUE or FALSE. We can also use <span class="bold">if</span> statements with an <span class="bold">else</span> clause that will execute when the clause behind <span class="bold">if</span> is FALSE.  Like this:

            4) <span class="bold">Check (print) intermediate results: </span> When your code doesn't crash, but doesn't behave as expected, add print statements to your program to see where in the code things stop behaving correctly.

            A string is structured data because we can operate on subsequences of strings but strings are limited to characters. A <span class="bold">list</span> is much more powerful than a string because the list is a sequence of not just characters but also numbers, strings, and other lists. With lists we use square brackets instead of quotes and separate the elements with commas. Lists support <span class="italic">mutations</span> which allow the programmer to alter the content of the original list without creating a new list. <span class="italic">Aliasing</span> lists is two ways to refer to the same object. Aliasing variable names for example, p and q, works like this:

Staying calm allows one to approach the problem systematically by writing small bits of code, testing them and knowing what they do.  Following these steps will ensure success: 1) Understand the inputs: what is the set of valid inputs and are there any assumptions? A smart programmer will write code defensively and check for validity of inputs.  How are they represented? 2) Understand the outputs: How should we specify the outputs? They should be based upon the original problem statement.  3) Solve the problem statement by understanding the relationships by working some examples.   Consider systematically how a human would solve the problem.  4) Create a simple mechanical solution. Humans are lazy, but computers are not.  Consider the power the computer has and transform your manual examples into simple code.   But don’t try to optimize prematurely.  Simplify and correct.  5) Develop incrementally and test as you go.

            Python is called an <span class="bold">"object-oriented programming language"</span> or <span class="italic">OOP</span>. This means there is a construct in Python called a class that lets you structure your code in a way that adds consistency and efficiency to your programs so that they can be used on a simple less complex level.  The idea is to reuse <span class"italic">standard</span> code that enables the programmer to develop innovative solutions with their code without getting mired in the complexity of the code at the lower levels of <span class="code">def __init__</span>; this is called <span class="bold">Abstraction</span> which is a technique for managing complexity of computer systems at a lower level.

            A <span class="bold">class</span> is a mechanism Python gives the programmer the ability to create user-defined types. Every object has a type and the object's type determines the operations the object supports i.e. does it have a length? And, this defines the possible values. A class is a way to take a grouping of functions and data and place them inside a container so the programmer can access them with the <span class="code">.</span> Operator.  Functions are still defined by <span class="code">def</span> is inside a class.
          </p>
          <p>
            An <span class="bold">instance</span> of a class for example the code: client = TwilioRestClient(account_sid, auth_token) <span class="code">client</span> is an instance of class TwilioRestClient. When we run the program containing the instances, the program contstructor gets called: <span class="code">__init__</span>. It is there that all the data is initialized for that instance.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold">Object</span> is synonymous with instance for example, the code brad = turtle.Turtle() <span class="code">brad</span> is an object of Turtle. And, quotes = open(file_location) <span class="code">quotes</span> is an object of File.
          </p>

            A <span class="bold">module</span> is a specialized dictionary that can store Python code to be accessed with the <span class="code">.</span> Operator.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <span class="bold">method</span> is a function that “belongs to” an object.  The term method is not unique to class instances.  Other object types can have methods as well, such as list objects have methods like append, insert and so on.

          <p>
            <span class="bold">Python Standard Library</span> describes the exact syntax and semantics of the Python language; this library reference manual describes the standard library that is distributed with Python. Good programmers reference this library to understand the modules available to import and their associated functions contained within.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold">Instance Variables</span> are the data contained within the <span class="code">__init__</span> function. For example, in the class Movie we have: self.title = movie_title, self.storyline =  movie_storyline, self.poster_image_url = poster_image and so on. These instance variables will be used each time we build the entertainment_center.py file.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold">Class variables</span> create efficient code because they are defined at the class level outside the <span class="code">__init__</span> function; this means that Instances can share this type of variable.  Per the Google Python Style Guide, if the class variable is constant, the programmer is advised to use all caps like this: <span class="bold">VALID_RATINGS</span>.

            <span class="bold">Inheritance</span> is an advanced idea of OOP. Inheritance allows the programmer to create a parent class with instance variables like last_name and eye_color that can be inherited or used by a child class. This child class aka subclass can also have instance variables of its own like number_of_toys; this reuse of code is a huge advantage of OOP that can help the programmer reuse improve the design of existing code.  For example, in the class Movie, instance variables like title and duration and instance methods like def show_trailer() and def get_local_listing() can be extracted and moved into their own class Video file that can be then shared and resued.

          <p>
            Before OOP, programming was normally seen as a series of logical procedures where the work of these procedures was to take the input and provide the desired output. OOP takes the view that what we really care about are the objects we want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. Examples of objects range from human beings (described by name, address, and so forth) to buildings and floors (whose properties can be described and managed) down to the buttons and scroll bars on a computer desktop.
          </p>
          <p>
            OOP is just one more <span class="italic">programming model</span> added to the programming world; it provides many <span class="bold">advantages</span>. 1) OOP is <span class="bold">modular</span>, as it provides separation of duties in object-based program development: 2) It is <span class="bold">extensible</span>, as objects can be extended to include new attributes and behaviors; and 3) Objects can also be <span class="bold">reused</span> within and across applications. Because of these three factors: modularity, extensibility, and reusability, object-oriented programming provides improved software-development productivity over traditional procedure-based programming techniques.  As a result, these three factors can also drive faster and lower cost of development, higher quality and improved maintainability of the software.  Simula was the first object-oriented programming language. Java, Python,  C++,  Visual Basic .NET, Smalltalk, and Ruby are the most popular OOP languages today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Companies are still using procedure programming in many small and limited time projects. There are problems that lend themselves well to functional or logic programming styles as well and applying OOP in those situations will not result in efficient programs. The <span class="bold">disadvantages</span> of OOP are 1) the <span class="bold">thought process</span> process involved in object-oriented programing may not be natural for some people, and it can take time to get used to it; 2) <span class="bold">Larger program sizes</span> due to more lines of code over procedural programming; 3) OOP programs are <span class="bold">slower</span> due to more instructions to be executed; and again, 4) not suitable for all applications or problems that need to be solved.
